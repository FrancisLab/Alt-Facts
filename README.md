# v-chill

A really, really useless Chrome Extension that makes your browser SO CHILL. 95% experimenting with Chrome, 5% a bad joke.

##### Features, such as they are:
1. All text is lowercase.
2. Unchill words are replaced with chill counterparts. `very` becomes `v`, for instance.
3. Actually that's it. Just those two.

Enable and disable from `chrome://extensions`.
